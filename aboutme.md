title: About me
---
Greetings and welcome to my webpage. My name is Jan-Willem and I am a PhD student at the <a href="https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/sociology"> Department of Sociology </a> at <a href="https://www.uu.nl/en"> Utrecht University</a>.    

My primary research interest is how social norms diffuse within polarized social network structures. I am also interested in the application of methods and statistics to social networks. For some samples of my work, please find my bachelor thesis on the statistical accuracy of hidden Markov models <a href="https://github.com/jwgsim/Bachelor-Thesis-Research-Archive"> here</a>, and my master thesis on the conditions under which a meta-analysis can be used to obtain a valid exponential random graph model over a network sample <a href="https://github.com/jwgsim/Master-Thesis-Research-Archive"> here</a>.
