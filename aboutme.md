title: About me

Greetings and welcome to my webpage. My name is Jan-Willem and I am a <a href="https://www.uu.nl/masters/en/methodology-and-statistics-behavioural-biomedical-and-social-sciences"> methodology and statistics</a> research master student at <a href="https://www.uu.nl/en"> Utrecht University</a>.    

My primary research interest is the application of methods and statistics to social networks. More specifically, I am interested in how methods and statistics can be used to increase understanding on social networks. This dual interest was sparked during my Sociology bachelor studies. During this time, I wrote a paper on the antecedents of negative social network ties on the network side of things, which I am currently in the process of publishing. On the methods and statistics side, I wrote my <a href="https://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/392939"> bachelor's thesis</a> on the statistical accuracy of hidden markov models. 

I ultimately decided to pursue a master in statistics to be able to pursue the more "technical" side of social network research. I am currently writing a master thesis at the Rijksuniversiteit Groningen where I am able to combine the two fields. The objective of the thesis is to investigate the conditions under which a meta-analysis can be used to obtain a valid exponential random graph model over a network sample.
