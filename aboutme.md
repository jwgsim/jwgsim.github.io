title: About me

Hello and welcome to my webpage. My name is Jan-Willem and I am a <a href="https://www.uu.nl/staff/JGSimons"> PhD student</a> at the Utrecht University <a href="https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/sociology">Sociology</a> department.    

My PhD research examines if and how (1) socialisation processes (or local social influences) and the media (or global social influences) shape ethnic majority attitudes and behaviours towards ethnic minorities and if and how (2) social norm and media interventions can be effective in promoting more positive attitudes and behaviours of ethnic majority towards ethnic minority members. To address the first research query, I use systematic reviews and meta-analyses, while to adress the second, I use agent-based modeling and social network experiments.

Beyond this main research focus, I am also interested in advancing statistical methods in the social and behavioural sciences, currently particularly for hidden Markov models and exponential random graph models.
