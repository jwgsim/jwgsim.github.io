Greetings and welcome to my webpage. My name is Jan-Willem and I am a <a href="https://www.uu.nl/staff/JGSimons"> PhD student</a> at the <a href="https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/sociology"> Utrecht University Sociology department</a>.    

The topic of my PhD thesis is on how social norms diffuse within polarized social network structures. I am also interested in the application of methods and statistics to social networks. For samples of my work, please find my bachelor thesis on the statistical accuracy of hidden Markov models <a href="https://github.com/jwgsim/Bachelor-Thesis-Research-Archive"> here</a>, and my master thesis on the conditions under which a meta-analysis can be used to obtain a valid exponential random graph model over a network sample <a href="https://github.com/jwgsim/Master-Thesis-Research-Archive"> here</a>.
